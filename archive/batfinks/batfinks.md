# Batfinks

After Steven passed on I collected together his online output into one place at batfinks.audio, it kept me occupied while I got used to the idea that he'd gone and brought to light music lots of people weren't aware of.  

Unfortunately the price for .audio domains became prohibitively expensive so I had to let the site expire, I've uploaded the entire archive (Markdown and audio files) to my Google Drive which you can download, it's just over 1GB
