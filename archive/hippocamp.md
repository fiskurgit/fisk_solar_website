# Hippocamp.net

Hippocamp was one of the early netlabels, it started in 2001 and was still releasing up to around 2015. I finally stopped paying for the site hosting in 2019.

Most of the releases are on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/hippocamp&tab=collection), later releases that were self hosted are [available as a zip from my Google Drive](https://drive.google.com) (link coming soon).
